This is a simple and working Minesweeper in Java (console window). 
Obviously not perfect but good enough for my teacher.
It was a school project and nothing big so if you have a Java Minesweeper as a school task,
feel free to hand this in after you've studied and understood the code.

_Note that I will not further work on this project or support issues or anything like that._
