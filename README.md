# minesweeper
This is another one of those projects I had to do for school.  
As you might have seen with some other repositories of mine, I like to document what I've done no matter how bad it was - it's a way to see how much I improve as a developer over time.

# Original Readme (archiving purposes)
This is a simple and working Minesweeper in Java (console window). 
Obviously not perfect but good enough for my teacher.
It was a school project and nothing big so if you have a Java Minesweeper as a school task,
feel free to hand this in after you've studied and understood the code.

_Note that I will not further work on this project or support issues or anything like that._
